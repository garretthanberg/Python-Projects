# Python-Projects
This repository hosts a collection of basic projects developed using Python, leveraging various modules such as tkinter and sqlite3 to enhance their functionality.

Phonebook:
Immerse yourself in the experience of a digital phonebook with this Python project. Built using tkinter for the graphical user interface, it enables users to save and manage contact information seamlessly. The application stores contact details, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers, in a database. Users can conveniently update and delete existing entries, ensuring that their contact information remains organized and easily accessible.

File Transfer GUI:
Streamline the process of transferring files between directories with this intuitive Python project. The graphical user interface, developed using tkinter, allows users to select a source directory and a destination directory for file transfers. All transferred files are recorded and saved in a database, providing a convenient log of the transferred files. This project simplifies file management and ensures that files are moved efficiently, with a record of each transfer for reference.

These Python projects demonstrate my proficiency in using modules such as tkinter and sqlite3 to create user-friendly applications. Feel free to explore and utilize these projects as learning resources or inspiration for your own Python endeavors.
