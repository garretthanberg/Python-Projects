# Python-Projects
This a repository of some basic projects I have made using Python. They use various modules such as tkinter and sqlite3.
  
Phonebook:
This project functions as if it were a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, email address, and of course their phone number in a database and allows the user to update and delete previous entries.

Check Files GUI:
This project allows the user to transfer files from one chosen directory to another. All the files that are moved will be saved in a database.
